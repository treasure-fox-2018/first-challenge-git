[//]: # (Ceritakan sedikit tentang latar belakangmu seperti pendidikan terakhir atau pekerjaan sebelumnya)

I graduated high school in May 2014 from GMIS & have since been to two universities. I tried a major in Engineering & changed my mind to a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance) & I am currently on a 'cuti lama' which ends in August this year.

[//]: # (Motivasi apa yang mendorongmu untuk ikut program coding bootcamp di Hacktiv8?)

In today's world, evey field you work in requires some application (if not knowledge) of technology. I'm trying to stay ahead of the curve by learning how to program and apply the practical programming skills in any field.

I found out about it from a friend and I thought it would be a good idea to join immediately.

[//]: # (Beri tahu kami, apa yang ingin kamu dapatkan di Hacktiv8 dan apa yang ingin kamu capai setelah lulus dari sini?)

I have not yet decided whether I will apply for a job or continue my studies directly after Hacktiv8. I will likely want to use the knowledge I have obtained here to make a website that will serve as my resume, facts about me, etc, as well as a fascinating tool that differentiates me in the eyes of the Employers.

My Indonesian is not good enough for me to use in my answers and so I will always code in english (pseudocode, algorithm, etc).
